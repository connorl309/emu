# SNES Emulator

This project is an attempt a SNES emulator. Currently, not planning on being cycle accurate, but instruction accurate.
This is an active (classes permitting) work in progress, focusing on:

- accuracy to the 65c816 architecture
- accuracy to the actual SNES itself
- an incursion into more of C++, like features from the STL
- using an actual build system instead of my own handwritten makefiles
- using libraries (such as SDL2) for the interface
- parsers and data manipulation

Enjoy the ride.
